# Random password generator

## Description

This project was created to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
A new, secure password is generated when the button is clicked. Then you are presented series of prompts for password criteria.
WHEN the password is generated it is written to the page.
The challenge helps to undestand the core skills of JavaScript: functions, loops, querySelector,addEventListener.
